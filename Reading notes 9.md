    Email: A method of exchanging messages between persons through electronic devices
    SaaS: Software as a service
    Standard Operating Procedure (SOP): A set guideline to follow when carrying out specific tasks, set by the company
 
 Reading Notes (https://www.thinkhdi.com/library/supportworld/2017/you-want-to-write-an-sop.aspx): 
        
        -Policy: general guidance
        
        -SOP: What, when, and why something needs to be done
        
        -Work instructions: Answers how; step by step instructions within an SOP
        
        -SOPs help in QA by ensuring consistency
        
        -SOPs need to be maintained; policy changes might have been made or a program updated so working instructions might need to be updated.
        
        -When creating SOP start with plan/outline/flow chart. 
        
        -Closely related topics should be contained together for ease of use
        
        Should be detailed and understandable but not overly detailed to be overbearing
        
        -SOP should contain opening paragraph summarizing the procedure and purpose
        
        -5 Guiding principles on writing SOP:
            1. Keep it simple: Keep as simple as possible while still being able to follow all steps
            2. SOPs must be portable: Its not useful to the company if Joe has the only copy and he is on vacation. Saving to a shared directory is one example of making it portable
            3. Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story: Pictures/diagrams can provide a lot of information quickly
            4. Consistency counts: SOP format standardization helps users to use SOPs efficiently 
            5. Its about the audience: The language and complexity of ideas described in SOPs should be developed with the user in mind
    
 
   Email:
      -Reasons we need to practice email service and client setup: 
        *troubleshooting issues
        *security risk
        *configuration and setup
        
      -Email utilizes a client-server architecture 
      -Modern email product example: Microsoft 365 which is a SaaS utilizing cloud-hosted software
      -Webmail an email service accessible via web browser
      -POP3 (Post Office Protocal3) is an inbound config that delivers messages to client then deletes off mail server immediately (older version of IMAP). Default POP Port: 110 POP Port with SSL/TLS: 995
      -IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocal): inbound config that allows you to manage a mailbocx from multiple devices and synchronize with mail server that saves a copy of all messages. Default Port: 143 Over SSL: 993
      -MAPI: Protocal used by Microsoft Exchange Servers; uses RPC encryption; dynamically assigned port
      -SMTP (Secure Message Transfer Protocal): Handles outbound email messages (port 25; secondary port 26; with SSL/TLS port 465
      -Email file extensions:
        *.eml
        *.emlx
        *.msg
        *.mbx
