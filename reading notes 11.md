    Vocab:
        Bad Blocks: corrupted storage segments that hamper storage and retrieval functions
    
    SSD Data Recovery Best Practices:
       Bad block can be suspected if computer is running more slow than usual and:
            *warnings for file system repair
            *Crashes
            *Stop booting except in read-only mode
       Methods to correcting corruptions in SSDs:
            *Reformatting drive and reinstalling OS 
            *Power cycling SSD for when corrupted due to power failure; idling at boot menu does similar function
            *Updating SSD Firmware/drivers
        *SSDs with TRIM are more likely to lose data permanently upon failure

       
      DBAN: 
      *multiple wipe options (DOD 7 passes, dodshort 3, autonuke 3)
      *interactive mode allows you to customize dban function


Lecture Notes:
    Data restoration:
      *Over time data becomes corrupted from use or malware
      *Quick repair tools are convenient but not as full-proof as full restore
      *Windows repair files> Control Panel>Programs and Features
    Secure data disposal:
      *Physical:shoot it, incineration, shredding
      Sanitization: DBAN
