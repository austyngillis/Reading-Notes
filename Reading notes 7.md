      Hackers are using bash scripts in place of malware to perform cyber attacks which can be loaded directly into memory and possibly                 undetectable

 Thoughts:
 
      Powershell is a very prevalent tool used in the industry over a range of professions and is certainly going to be a useful skill for me to         develop. 
      Based on the fact that powershell is now being used for cyber attacks it would seem it is important to at least have some understanding of         it in order to counter hackers.
