Reading notes 2: GitHub and VS Code
  Vocabulary:
   Commit: Save changes to respository
   Fork: A duplicate/copy of someone's repository; useful for testing things
   Push: Upload changes to repository
  
  
  GitHub:
    GitHub provides different payment/service plans that suit the varying needs of coders
    Every repository should have a readme.md as the first page
    When "committing" you have option to do a pull request which lets others let you know what changes have been made to open discussion about it
    Scenario: If there is an error in a repository, I can fork it, fix the error, then submit a pull request to the owner to suggest the fix
VS Code: 
  Source code editor available on all major OS
    Built in support for major languages and extensions for more
    
    Getting familiar with VSCode and GitHub and understanding them as tools is invaluable in this workspace and class. Although I am still getting used to the layout of VScode I can tell it is a powerful tool.
