Reading notes 2: GitHub and VS Code
  Vocabulary:
   Commit: Save changes to respository
   Fork: A duplicatye/copy of repository; useful for testing things
  
  
  GitHub:
    GitHub provides different payment/service plans that suit the varying needs of coders
    Every repository should have a readme.md as the first page
    When "committing" you have option to do a pull request which lets others let you know what changes have been made to open discussion about it
    Scenario: If there is an error in a repository, I can fork it, fix the error, then submit a pull request to the owner to suggest the fix
