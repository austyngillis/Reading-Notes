Lecture notes:
      IP Addresses: Devices use these as addresses
      MAC Addresses: hardware address; built in and already assigned. 
      Subnets: Subdivision within network
      Network Devices: 
         Switch; trafficbetween devices; local
         Hub: Like a switch but sends to all local ports; only the device that needs it will typically accept it
         Routers: Act as gateway to other networks
         Firewalls: Controls network traffic
      DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocal): assigns IP addresses within network; prevents overlapping
      DNS (Domain Name Service): Translates domain names to IP addresses
      pfSense:
      *virtualizes a firewall/router
      *open source
